# Virtual-Coffee-Machine-CV
CV-Coffee-Machine is a project that employs computer vision technology to revolutionize the process of ordering a cup of coffee. The project is built using machine learning algorithms and image processing techniques that enable the system to recognize hand gestures made by the user and generate an order based on the user's preferences. 

The system requires a camera that captures real-time video footage of the user making hand gestures, which are analyzed using the mediapipe library to determine the user's order. The system can recognize a range of gestures, using finger detection, the user can pick the type of coffee, the amount of sugar, and the size of the cup.

The system makes it possible for users to create and customize their perfect cup of coffee without ever having to touch a single button or dial, and zero human interaction - entirely automated. The user interface is simple and intuitive, making it easy for anyone to use, and the system can be customized to accommodate a wide range of coffee preferences. The project demonstrates how computer vision can be used to enhance user experiences. 

A few applications:
